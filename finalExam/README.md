In spite of the folder name this is not the actual test but close to.

You will have both an .Rmd file with the code to fix and a printed pdf of the desired output. You can use R on your laptop to test your solutions, but what is to be delievered is the printout with your corrections to the code and the T/F.

This mock test is from last semester, thus questions on the actual test may include other topics as well (functions date/time manipulation, joining tables). The goal is not to test your ability to memorize functions, but to make sure you can solve general issues in the code using R and the documentation available.
