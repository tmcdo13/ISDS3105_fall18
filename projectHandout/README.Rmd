## What is Open Data

source: [Open Data BR - about](https://data.brla.gov/about) 

The concept of open data is quite simple â€“ to "open up" access to public information of all types, thereby letting the public consume and interact with data in a variety of ways. This data may be used to facilitate decision making; encourage innovation through the development of tools or applications to further support public data consumption; hold government departments and agencies accountable and promote transparency; and much more.

Open Data BR is an initiative that exists as part of a broader commitment to the residents of Baton Rouge focused on creating a more efficient, effective and responsive City-Parish government while developing Baton Rouge into a hub for digital growth and technological innovation.

More specifically, Open Data BR is focused on providing access to data and information, which can be utilized to create efficiencies and improve coordination among City-Parish departments, streamline citizen engagement, encourage economic development and business innovation, and support a more effective, responsive, transparent and connected City-Parish government. At the City-Parish level, department heads and staff can utilize this kind of data to identify trends and gaps in services, and efficiently allocate resources. Meanwhile, residents and businesses can use the same data to better understand government and build solutions to improve the services provided by local, public-sector agencies.


## Your Goal

Your goal is to leverage open data to analyze a relevant issue for the city of Baton Rouge. Ideally, you want to summarise the goal of your project in one main research question that your presentation will address (see [Developing a (non-trivial) Research Question](#RQ)).

There are no restrictions regarding the final output of your work. Although an HTML page is arguably the most portable output, often a printable PDF-document might help to present your story more linearly. Every format has peculiar strengths and challenges, so do not feel like something interactive will necessarily be superior: it all depends on how it is implemented.

Your final presentation (25-30mins) should cover:

#. What is your research question/the problem you are trying to solve?

#. What is the design and of your artifact? For instance, if you use different data sources, how do you aggregate them? 

#. Presenting your results and limitations. What did you find? Any technical aspect that you are particularly proud of? Any issues with the data (e.g., missing values, suspicious patterns)

#. Present your work

There are no specific guidelines regarding the presentation format. You can directly present the dashboard you created, HTML markdown, pdf or powerpoint. 

You will present in the conference room 2240. Please discuss within your group your availabilities and let me know by **November, 20** when you can present - I will reserve the conference room for you. 


# Getting Started with the Project


## Developing a (non-trivial) Research Question {#RQ}

Picking a research question that is **relevant** to the community is crucial, but it also needs to be non-trivial. For instance, "how many committed crimes occur each month?" is relevant for assessing crime rates, but you want to target a higher level of sophistication. For instance, "does crime rate increase during natural disasters?". Addressing this question require you do isolate crisis events that constitute natural disasters (e.g., 2016 Flood), understand if there is an increase during that time period ("increase" compared to what? Is it just seasonal of due to the flood?), and maybe understand whether the increase is due to specific disaster-related crimes (e.g., looting).

You can add layers of complexity by zooming-in to look at neighborhoods instead of the whole city, or zoom-out to compare Baton Rouge with [New Olreans](https://datadriven.nola.gov/home/).

## Integrating External Datasource

Aggregating external data sources can be beneficial to enhance the informativeness of the analysis. If you get lucky, the dataset you are looking for might be available online on platforms such as [statista](https://www.statista.com/) or [kaggle](www.kaggle.com/), other times you may need a scraper.


## Organize your Project Repository

Keep your project on a GitHub repo (public or private). You want to use the README file on the first page as an "abstract" of your project. For instance, you can add the research question, and explanation of your output, the major findings, screenshots of your dashboard, or anything that would motivate the reader to take a look at what your code does.

To make your repository more accessible, try to manage the structure of your folder effectively, for instance:

```{}
\R          #sometimes it is useful to split your code in multiple R scripts
\figure     #ggplot charts, logos, figures, and general visual static content
\data       #the dataset you are using (consider whether you want them in .csv/.tvs or .RDta)
\Rmd        #.Rmd files for your report(s)
index.html  #the HTML version of your presentation if needed
README      #this is your "abstract""
```


## Reproducibility

When working with real data, you may need some preliminary data wrangling, cleaning, etc. Records may come from open text fields, which means misspellings, missing values, and oddities due to actual users typing-in records. Make sure the code you write for fixing those issues can always take you from the raw data (as accessed through the API) to the dataset formatted as you need it for the analysis. Thus, you want your code to be as robust and reproducible as possible. For instance, what if we new rows or new columns are added to a table you are querying? Would your code still run smoothly?


## Grading criteria

This project is the chance for you to explore the magnificent world of R. The main goal is to build on what you have learned so far and to independently explore new tools for investigating of a research question of your choice. Some of the aspects that would make a good project are:

  #. Picking a research question that is **relevant** and non-trivial: you may not reach an ultimate answer, but do it are you best.
  
  #. **Explore new tools**, for instance: using new libraries for plotting, creating a template for your pdf reports, use statistical modeling, add interactivity to ggplot charts.
  
  #. **Integrate external resources**. Looking at the bigger picture is sometimes critical to fully understand what the data might tell us. Variables such as crime rates might be more meaningful when combined with income data. However, that information may not be available from Open Data BR.
  
  #. What did you find? Do not overreach with when presenting your **findings** and be aware of your **limitations**. 
  
  #. Make sure that your analysis is **reproducible**. Ideally, anyone should be able to run your code an replicate the results.
  
  #. Make your code **readable code**: it will be faster for your team to recall what your code does. This means not only formatting and commenting your code if needed, but also keep it concise.

Grades will virtually be the same for every member of the team unless evidence of severe misconduct arises. Every team will have members who are stronger in coding than others, but coding is not the only skill in play. Make sure you organize your project such that each member can productively contribute to the final output.

## Seeking help from the R Community

If you need help with your code, you should consider searching/posting on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Before you post, make sure you reduce your problem into a [reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example). Issues that are not reproducible are unlikely to receive any responses at all.

Also, you can tag [me](https://github.com/DarioBoh) in your GitHub issues and feel free to message me a reminder if I do not respond within 24hours. I will not provide a fully working solution, but I will do my best to help you troubleshoot or to point you to a resource that might help you solve the problem.

Our Slack group. Others may be dealing with a similar issue, although they are investigating a different research question. Do not be too jealous of your code, which is only a tool and not the ultimate goal of the project. Sharing your code is a good way to receive feedback on it.
