# Trump’s Tweets

Read the below dataset on from
<https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/trump-twitter>.
Then use the appropriate function from the package `lubridate` to
convert `created_at` into a date.

Use `geom_histogram` to plot a histogram of tweets count. Change the
x-axis title into ‘date’ and the x-axis labels into a `mon 'yy` format
(e.g., `Dec '15`).

Note that there is a difference between time and datetime: If you coerce
`created_at` to a datetime (which keeps information about the time too),
you will need `scale_x_datetime` instead of
`scale_x_date`

``` r
dt <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/trump-twitter/realDonaldTrump_poll_tweets.csv')
```

# Income map

Use the below dataset to plot a choropleth map of incomes by state. Map
`median_household_income` to the state fill. For a shapefile of the US
states use `map_data("state")`. Adjust the legend setting the title to
“Median income” and formatting the scale as
`$xx,xxx`.

``` r
dt <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv')
```

Repeat the above for the Deep South only (Louisiana, Alabama,
Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina). Add a title.

Use inline code to output the median income (appropriately formatted)
and the Gini-Index for Louisiana.
