# Assignment 5

Produce a map of the locations for the emergency calls during the Lousiana Flood, 2016 in the East Baton Rouge area. The output should look similar to the below: 

<div style="width:50%">![](mapEmergencyCalls.png)</div>

Feel free to choose the style of the map (e.g., satellite, watercolor), the color-pallette, and other aesthetical attributes, but your map should at least show:

- the locations for calls to 311 calls for "DRAINAGE, EROSION, FLOODING OR HOLES"
- the locations for calls to firebrigade for "SEVERE WEATHER OR NATURAL DISASTER, OTHER" or "WATER EVACUATION"  
- the locations for calls to 911 for "LOOTING"

As a timespan, use calls between '2016-08-12' and '2016-08-22'.

Refer to the notes from `lesson11_openData/BRflood2016.R` for how to use the Socrata API to extract the emergency calls data from [BR OpenData](https://data.brla.gov/).
