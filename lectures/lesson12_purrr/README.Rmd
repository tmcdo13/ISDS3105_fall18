# Why do we need to iterate?

Suppose you want to calculate the mean value for each row of the below tibble:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
t <- tibble( x = list(
                sample(c(1:10), size = 10, replace = T),
                sample(c(1:10), size = 10, replace = T),
                sample(c(1:10), size = 10, replace = T)
            ))
t
```

Using `mean()` on the column-list doesn work: 

```{r}
mean(t$x)
```

Instead, you want to apply `mean()` to each element of `x`.


## Iteration using for-loops

One way of iterating is by using a for-loop. For loops have three elements: output, sequence, body

```{r}

x <- list(1, 'hi', TRUE, T) 

output <- vector("list", length(x))  # output
for (i in seq_along(x)) {            # sequence
  output[i] <- typeof(x[[i]])        # body
}

output
```

1. **Output**: The object that will contain our output. Because for-loops have a known number of iterations, we should always be able to predict how many values we will have in output and to allocate space accordingly.

2. **sequence**: Indicates when to exit the for-loop. Each iteration will assign to `i` a different value from `seq_along(x)`.

3. **body**: This is the code that instructs R on what to do at each iteration.


Build a for-loop to calcualte the mean for each element of `t`

```{r}

output <- vector("list", nrow(t))      # output

for (i in seq_along(t$x)) {     # sequence
  output[i] = mean(t$x[[i]])           # body
}
```

Note how "filling" `t` is more efficient than iteratively add elements to `t` using indexing:

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
t <- tibble(x = rep(t$x, 100))
microbenchmark(
  #below is the code for the for-loop specifing the dimensions of `output`
  preparringOutput = {
   output <- vector("double", length(t$x))  
   #########################################
   ## copy here the code for the for-loop ##
   #########################################
  },
  #below is the same for-loop WITHOUT specifing the dimensions of `output`
  withoutPreparring =   { 
    output <- NULL
   #########################################
   ## copy here the code for the for-loop ##
   #########################################
  }
)
```


## Iterate using `purrr::map()`

We can imitate for-loop iterations using `purrr::map()` (check `?map` for an overview of all the functions within the map family):

```{r}
x <- list(1, 'hi', TRUE, T) 
map(.x = x, .f = typeof)
```

The main advantage of using `map()` is to have a more concise syntax, but note how iterations with map are also faster:

```{r}
x <- rep(x, 50)
microbenchmark(
  withMap = { map(x, typeof) },
  withLoop = {
    output <- vector("list", length(x)) 
    for (i in seq_along(x)) { output[i] <- typeof(x[[i]]) }
  }
)
```


To pass the arguments of the function `.f`, when have to options:

- list them in `...` for instance `map(.x = x, .f = sum, na.rm = T)`
- create a anonymous function for instance `map(.x = x, .f = ~ sum(.x, na.rm = T))`

```{r}
#load the environment load(here::here('data', 'dataset.rdata'))
# calculate the quarterly means of iphoneSales removing NAs
load(here::here('data', 'dataset.rdata'))
purrr::map(.x = iphoneSales, .f = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = T))
```


## Use map() to pluck elements

You can use `map()` to extract elements from an object

```{r}
t <- tibble(nums = list(obs1 = c(a = 'first', b = 'second'), 
                        obs2 = c(a = 'first'), 
                        obs3 = c(a = 'first', b = 'second', c = 'third')))

t %>% mutate(nums = map(.x = nums, 2, .default = as.character(NA)))
#' we can simplify the data structure to an atomic vector using 
#' the functions map_chr, map_int, map_dbl, map_lgl
t %>% mutate(nums = map_chr(.x = nums, 2, .default = as.character(NA)))

#using map() to pluck values like iterating the subset function `[`
t %>% mutate(nums = map_chr(.x = nums, `[`, 2))
```

You can extract also by element name:

```{r}
t %>% mutate(nums = map_chr(.x = nums, 'b', .default = NA))
```



## Rethinking assignment 4: iterating ggplot() function calls

Assignment 4 asked to plot a map of insurance premiums for the South US only. Below are two approaches to rethink at that problem in a more scalable way, for instance assuming we wanted to plot multiple regions on different maps. Since each map will show the same variables, we can think about iterating the call to `ggplot()`:

```{r}
states <- map_data("state") #load the shapefile of US states
# create a variable to split by US-region
bad_driversSouth <- bad_drivers %>%
                        mutate(isSouth = case_when(state %in% c('Louisiana', 'Alabama', 'Mississippi', 'Georgia', 'South Carolina') ~ 'South',
                                                   T ~ 'Other'),
                               state = tolower(state))


bad_driversSouth %>% 
  split(.$isSouth) %>% 
  purrr::map(~ right_join(.x, states, by = c('state' = 'region')) %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(insurance_premiums)) %>% 
                      ggplot() +
                      geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = insurance_premiums), color = "white") + 
                      coord_fixed(1.3) +
                      labs(title = paste('Insurance premiums')))

```


Another approach is to leverage the tibble data structure to nest variables by the splitting variable `isSouth`: 


```{r}
bad_driversNested <- bad_driversSouth %>% group_by(isSouth) %>% nest()

bad_driversNested <- bad_driversNested %>% 
 mutate(chart = purrr::map(.x = data, ~ right_join(.x, states, by = c('state' = 'region')) %>% 
                      filter(!is.na(insurance_premiums)) %>% 
                      ggplot() +
                      geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = insurance_premiums), color = "white") + 
                      coord_fixed(1.3) +
                      labs(title = paste('Insurance premiums'))))
bad_driversNested$chart[1]
```


```{r}
#' Use map to produce 3 charts: Southern State, Mountain states, Others. 
#' Follow one of the 2 approaches above or to come up with your own, but don't 
#' forget to iterate the call to ggplot() rather then typing it down multiple times
mountainStates <- c('Montana', 'Wyoming', 'Colorado', 'New Mexico', 'Idaho', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'Nevada')

```
