The example below shows how to iterate a call to ggplot() over multiple arguments. In particular, we want to iterate over different datasets and different names to create multiple charts of a subset of data. We will use the same logic when knitting parametrized reports in RMarkdown, so understanding how `map()` works can really help you to scale up things.

```{r}
#Consider the dataset
bad_driversSouth <- bad_drivers %>% 
                      mutate(
                        isSouth = case_when(
                          state %in% c('Louisiana', 'Alabama', 'Mississippi', 'Georgia', 'South Carolina') ~ 'South',
                          T ~ 'Other'),
                        state = tolower(state))

bad_driversNested <- bad_driversSouth %>% group_by(isSouth) %>% nest()
mapData <- as_tibble(map_data("state"))

bad_driversNested <- bad_driversNested %>% mutate(stateShape = purrr::map(.x = data, ~ inner_join(.x, mapData, by = c('state' = 'region'))))
```

```{r}
#function to draw the chart
drawMap <- function(data, title) {
                   ggplot(data = data) +
                      geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = insurance_premiums), color = "white") + 
                      coord_fixed(1.3) +
                      labs(title = paste('Insurance Preiums for ', title)) +
    scale_fill_gradient(labels = scales::dollar_format())
}

bad_driversNested <- bad_driversNested %>% 
  mutate(stateMap = pmap(list(data = .$stateShape, title = .$isSouth), .f = drawMap))
# OR: mutate(stateMap = map2(.x = .$stateShape, .y = .$isSouth, drawMap)) 
```

## Invoking different functions

With `map` can iterate one function over multiple elements. For iterating multiple function over one parameters We want to plot the correlation between insurance_premiums and losses

```{r}
#calculate variance, correlation, covariance
invoke_map(list(var, cor, cov), list(list(x = bad_drivers$insurance_premiums, y = bad_drivers$perc_alcohol)))

#calculate mean and median for one variable
invoke_map(list(avg = mean, IIQ = median), x = bad_drivers$insurance_premiums)
invoke_map_df(list(avg = mean, IIQ = median), x = bad_drivers$insurance_premiums)
```

Although for tasks like the above is easier to use variations of the dplyr verbs we already familiarized with:

```{r}
bad_drivers %>% summarise(mean = mean(num_drivers), median = median(num_drivers))
bad_drivers %>% summarise_at(vars(num_drivers), .funs = funs(mean, median))

bad_drivers %>% mutate_if(is.integer, .funs = funs(paste0(., '%')))
bad_drivers %>% mutate_at(vars(starts_with('perc')), .funs = funs(paste0(., '%')))
```


## Exercise

```{r}
hotels <- read_csv(here::here('data','taipeiHotel', 'hotel.csv'))
performance <- read_csv(here::here('data','taipeiHotel', 'performance.csv'))
```

Create an ggplot function to draw a linechart of the `AverageRoomRate` over time (`Month`) and save it into a folder 'timeLines'. Use iteration to create a separate chart of each hotel and save it. Make sure each chart is titled and saved meaningfully.

```{r}
#' HINTS:
#' start off simple: create a function that takes 1 dataset and a title/filename and plots/saves 1 plot for 1 hotel
#' check ?ggsave() to learn how to save ggplot files. Use `here()` if you need to specify a filepath. Ideally,
#' you want to combine hotel names with file extensions (e.g., png, jpeg) to create meaningful file names. Then, you 
#' want to save each file into ISDS3105_fall/lectures/lesson13_purrr_2/timeLines.
#' You could use `dir.create()` to create the `timeLines` directory - perhaps conditionally using `dir.exists()`
#' if the folder does not exists yet.
```
