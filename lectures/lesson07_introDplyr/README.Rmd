# Data analysis

`dplyr` is a package within the `tidyverse` designed for data manipulation: transforming, selecting, grouping and summarizing variables. The philosphy of `dplyr` is to offer a more intuitive syntax than base R. Also, it makes easy to translate R/dplyr code into SQL queries, which means we can use dplyr to query remote sources such as a MySQL database.

## The pipe operator

To use the tidyverse more efficiently, the `tidyverse` introduces an operator that is not originally available in base R, but allows to _chain_ functions together, rather than _nesting_ them. This operator `%>%` is called the pipe. 
What the `%>%` does, is to pass the value that preceeds `%>%` to the first position of the subsequent function (or alternatively anywhere you place a `.`). For instance:

```{r}
round(mean(c(1:10, NA), na.rm = T), 0)
```

Can be written as
```{r}
c(1:10, NA) %>% 
  mean(na.rm = T) %>% 
  round(0)
```

Which is equivalent to 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
c(1:10, NA) %>% 
  mean(x = . , na.rm = T) %>% #the dot is just a pronoun for what precedes the pipe operator
  round(x = ., digits = 0)
```


## dplyr verbs

dplyr has seven fundamental verbs for data manipulation.

To manipulate rows:

   - `filter()`: select rows
   - `distinct()`: select unique set of rows
   - `arrange()`: sort rows

To manipulate columns:

   - `select()`: select/drop columns
   - `mutate()`: add columns
   
To group:

  - `group_by()`: group by a variable(s)
  - `count()`: sum grouping by a variable(s)
  - `summarise()`: run a function producing 1 output for each grouping level

To manipulate dataframes:

  - `*_join()`: merge multiple dataframe together
  
## Manipulating rows

### Filter

`filter()` retrieves all rows that evaluate to `TRUE`:

```{r}
#to retain all Spanish males:
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  filter(country == 'Spain' & gender == 'Male')
#to retain only casualties in 2014 and 2015
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  filter(between(year, 2014, 2015))
```

1. Using `titanicDt`, filter the count of female children who did not survive
```{r}

```

2. Using `beerDt`, filter the records from 1903 to 1997 (use the shortcut `dplyr::between()`)
```{r}

```

3. Using `untidyReview`, filter all records with missing values on `reviewLocation`. Hint: you need to use `is.na()` to test what elements are missing.
```{r}

```

4. Using `selfiesCasualties`, filter all records for victims who dies abroad (`country` different than `nationality`)
```{r}

```

To filter positionally, use `slice()` or `filter(between(row_number(), 1, 10))`. For instance, to filter the first 3 rows from `titanicDt`

```{r}
slice(titanicDt, 1:3) 
titanicDt %>% filter(between(row_number(), 1, 3))
```


### Distinct

`distinct` retains unique rows from the input table grouping by the variables specified. For instance, the combination of unique country-gender combinations:

```{r}
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  filter(country == 'Spain' & gender == 'Male') %>% 
  distinct(country, gender)
```

Note that `distinct` will also automatically drop all columns that are not passed into `distinct`. To keep all columns in the dataset, you need to specify `.keep_all = FALSE`.

1. Using `selfiesCasualties`, subset the dataset by the distinct levels for `class`
```{r}

```

2. Using `titanicDt`, create a 2 columns dataset for the unique combinations of `Age` and `Sex`
```{r}

```



### Arrange

`arrange` sorts the rows by the grouping variables you pass to the function:

```{r}
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  arrange(class)
```

1. Using `titanicDt`, arrange by Class, Age, Sex
```{r}

```

2. Using `titanicDt`, arrange descending by `n`
```{r}

```

## Manipulate Columns

### Select and mutate

`select` keeps only the variables you pass (or it drops them if you use `-`). For example to select only `class` and `country`:
```{r}
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  select(class, country)
```

To select multiple columns, you can use `class:age` (from variable class to variable gender), or any from the `?select_helpers`.

1. Using `sn_revenue`, select only variables for company names and year 2015.
```{r}

```

2. Using `untidyReview`, select only the variables containing review ratings.
```{r}

```


`mutate()` instead adds a new variable. For example, we can add the birthdate of the victims by subtracting their age from the year of the accident:

```{r}
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  mutate(birthDate = year - as.numeric(age))
```

1. Using `beerDt`, convert the consumption from gallons per capita to liters (1 gallon 3.78 liters)
```{r}

```

2. Using `socialNetwork_users` add a percent sign to the variable percent (use `paste0()`)
```{r}

```

3. Using `untidyReview`, turn `reviewStayYear` into a integer
```{r}

```


### Grouping

`group_by` converts your tibble into subgroups depending on the grouping variable(s). It is usually used to group data before summarising with `summarise`. For instance, to count the number of female and male victims by country:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  group_by(country, gender) %>% 
  summarise(tot = n())
```

1. Using `titanicDt`, calculate the average casualties by class (note that the dataset has both survivors/non-survivors counts)
```{r}

```

2. Using `titanicDt`, calculate the average casualties by gender (note that the dataset has both survivors/non-survivors counts)
```{r}

```

3. Using `beerDt`, calculate the average consumption before and after your birthyear (hint: you may create a new variable)
```{r}

```

4. Using `titanicDt`, calulcate the count of casualties by nationality, then arrange descending.
```{r}

```


`n()` is the count operator in dplyr (it works only within a `summarise()`, `mutate()` or `filter()`), and counts the rows by group level without taking any argument. Note that every time you use `summarise()`, your tibble drops one grouping level. For instance in the latter example, data are still grouped by country, and any further dplyr verb would apply groupwise unless we `ungroup()` first.

Because counting observations is a very common task, dplyr offers the wrapper `count`, which is equivalent to `group_by %>% summarise( n() )` except that it `ungroup()` after. 

```{r}
selfiesCasualties %>% 
  count(country, gender)
```

Exercise: Use `selfiesCasualties` to calculate the percent of casualties by class. One way, is to combine `groub_by()`, `sum()` and `n()`. Make sure you understand the difference between `sum()` and `n()` and how they behave when grouping.


## Manipulating dataframes

Sometimes you need to combine different datasets into one. To join different dataset, you need at least one variable showing what is the relationship between the datasets and how to join them. For instance, consider the case where you have two separates dataset about the count of twitter and FB users during the same years (Source: eMarketer):

```{r}
twitter_users
fbMobile_users
```

You want to create a single dataset containing the records for both. You can use `full_join` to bind together facebook and twitter users by year:

```{r}
twitter_users %>% 
  full_join(fbMobile_users, by = c('Year' = 'Year'), suffix  = c('twitter', 'fb'))
#also inner_join(fbMobile_users, by = 'Year', suffix  = c('twitter', 'fb'))
```

Note that if you do not pass a character vector of variables to join, `*_join` uses all the variables with common names across the two tables.

The last example is simple because both datasets have the same number of rows and values, does `full_join`, `left_join, or `right_join` gives the same result. However, say we add one extra value for `fbMobile_users` and `twitter_users`. In the following example instead we need to consider which join is the most appropriate since `fbMobile_users`:

```{r}
fbMobile_users <- fbMobile_users %>% 
  add_row(Year = 2014, millions = 122) %>% arrange(Year)

twitter_users <- twitter_users %>% 
  add_row(Year = 2021, millions = 74.6) %>% arrange(Year)
```

By default, `full_join` creates an `NA` for the missing observation in `fbMobile_users` for 2021:

```{r}
fbMobile_users %>% 
  full_join(twitter_users, by = 'Year', suffix  = c('twitter', 'fb'))
```


To keep only the years for those which appear in both datasets:

```{r}
fbMobile_users %>% 
  inner_join(twitter_users, by = 'Year', suffix  = c('twitter', 'fb'))
```


Morover:

```{r}
#use ?left_join() ... to view the documentation
left_join(twitter_users, fbMobile_users, by = 'Year') #retain all records from A, add those from B that match ()
right_join(twitter_users, fbMobile_users, by = 'Year') #retain all records from B, add those from A that match
anti_join(twitter_users, fbMobile_users, by = 'Year') #retain all records from A with not matches in B (keep just columns from A)
semi_join(twitter_users, fbMobile_users, by = 'Year') #retain all records from A with matches in B (keep just columns from A)
```


# Exercise

```{r}
#we need 2 datasets from ncyflights13 package:
if (!require(nycflights13)) install.packages('nycflights13')
#flights
#airlines
```


1. Use the appropriate join to add the full carrier names to `flights` using `airlines` :

```{r}

```


2. Count the number of flights for each carrier using the full carrier name. Then plot a bar chart of the counts.

```{r}

```

3. Calculate the average visibility for the flights by each carrier. Plot the result in a barchart.

```{r}

```

4. What is the busiest route?

```{r}

```

5. What's the busiest day for each of the departing airports? 

```{r}

```
