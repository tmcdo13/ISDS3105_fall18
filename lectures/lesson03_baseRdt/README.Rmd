# Data frame

To create a data frame, use the function `data.frame`:

```{r}
#data from https://www.statista.com/statistics/804398/us-iphone-sales-by-model/
iphoneSales <- data.frame(
                  time = c("Sep 2014", "Sep 2015", "Sep 2016", "Dec 2016", "Sep 2017", "Dec 2017", "Jun 2018"), 
                  iPhone4S = c(9, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA), 
                  iPhone5C = c(15.5, 5, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA), 
                  iPhone5S = c(30, 19, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA), 
                  iPhoneSE = c(NA, NA, 9.5, 6, 11, 7, 8), 
                  iPhone6 = c(33, 33, 5, NA, NA, NA, NA), 
                  iPhone6Plus = c(12.5, 19, 7, NA, NA, NA, NA), 
                  iPhone6S = c(NA, 16, 19, 11, 10, 6, 8), 
                  iPhone6SPlus = c(NA, 8, 12.5, 10, 4.5, 2, 3), 
                  iPhone7 = c(NA, NA, 31, 40, 28.5, 13, 16), 
                  iPhone7Plus = c(NA, NA, 16, 32.1, 29.5, 11, 11), 
                  iPhone8 = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, 6, 24, 13), 
                  iPhone8Plus = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, 10.5, 17, 24), 
                  iPhoneX = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 20.1, 17))

```


Dataframes are a special case of a list, where each element is a vector of the same length but possibly different type. For instance:

```{r}
str(iphoneSales)
class(iphoneSales)
typeof(iphoneSales)
```


Indexing works similarly to vectors, but note the difference between _extracting_ and _selecting_:

```{r}
#selecting
iphoneSales['iPhone4S']
iphoneSales[2]
#extracting
iphoneSales[['iPhone4S']]
iphoneSales[['iPhone4S']][1]
iphoneSales[,2]
iphoneSales$iPhone4S
```


```{r}
#For readability, show the code but hide the output of this chucnk once you tested the solutions
# use dataframe[row,col] to

#extract the first two elements of column "IPhone6s"

#subset iphoneSales to a dataframe with only time, iPhone5C, IPhoneX

#keep only the rows where the sales for iPhoneSE are higher than 7 AND are not NA (AND = &, OR = |, NOT = !)

#Use %in% to keep only the rows for c("Sep 2014", "Sep 2015", "Sep 2018")

#calculate the mean() of the IPhone7 sold 

#use inline code to print the mean of the iphone sold in Jun 2018

```


However, the `tidyverse` is best suited for using rectangular data structures called `tibbles` instead of data frames. To convert a `data.frame` into a `tibble`:

```{r}
as_tibble(iphoneSales)
class(as_tibble(iphoneSales))
typeof(as_tibble(iphoneSales))
```

Because tibbles are also dataframes, you can use indexing as you would do on a `data.frame`. However, a crucial difference between tibbles and dataframe is that tibbles allow to have column-list elements while dataframes allow only column-vectors:

```{r}
iphoneSales_tibble <- tibble(year = c(2017, 2018), 
                    iphones = list(
                      c(iphone7 = 13, iphone7plus = 11), 
                      c(iphone7 = 16, iphone7plus = 11))
                    )
iphoneSales_tibble

iphoneSales_df <- data.frame(year = c(2017, 2018), 
       iphones = list(list(iphone7 = 13, iphone7plus = 11), list(iphone7 = 16, iphone7plus = 11)))
iphoneSales_df
```


```{r}
# from iphoneSales_tibble extract the *vector* with the amounts of iphone7/7plus sold in 2017


```

##The pipe operator

Before moving into tidyverse, we need to familiarize with the `%>%` (pipe), an operator that enables to chain functions rather than nesting them. That makes the code easier to process for humans rather than nesting multiple functions. For instance:
```{r}
round(mean(c(1:10, NA), na.rm = T), 0)
```

You can "pipe" the above functions using `%>%` (shortcut: shift+cmd/ctrl+I), which passes the output that preceeds `%>%` to the first argument of the subsequent function (or alternatively anywhere you place a `.`). For instance:

```{r}
c(1:10, NA) %>% 
  mean(na.rm = T) %>% 
  round(0)
```

Which is equivalent to 
```{r}
c(1:10, NA) %>% 
  mean(x = . , na.rm = T) %>% 
  round(x = ., digits = 0)
#' the dot is just a pronoun for what precedes the pipe operator
#' sometimes you don't want to pipe into the first argument
c('hello', 'hi', 'bye', 'ciao') %>% 
  gsub('ciao', 'hello', .)
```


```{r}
# `$` is a function too. Can you pipe `iphoneSales` to `$` to extract the vectro `iPhoneX`? Then, calculate the mean removing NAs

```
