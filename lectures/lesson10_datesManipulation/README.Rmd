## Introduction

To have the right class associated to date/time data is crucial to manipulate them effectively. Dates often come as strings, but R will not make any assumption about your intention to create a date until you specify so. For instance, suppose we want to calculate the distance between two dates:

```{r, error=TRUE}
myDate <- c("2018-03-19", "2018-03-20")
diff(myDate)   #does not work:
class(myDate)  #myDate is a character vector
```

In base R, you can use the function `as.Date` to coerce `myDate` to an object of class `Date`:

```{r}
myDate <- as.Date(myDate)
str(myDate)
diff(myDate)
```

Dates R essentially numbers indicating the days from a certain origin (default to `1970-01-01`):
```{r}
typeof(myDate) 
as.double(as.Date('1970-01-01'))
```

However, `as.Data` is not very flexible in recognizing dates when their format differs from `yyyy-mm-dd`. For instance:

```{r, error=TRUE}
as.Date('1918-11-04')
as.Date('1918/11/04')
as.Date('19181104')
```

You can still specify the formatting rules in `as.Date`to parse the character string. Check `?strptime` for the conversion specifications:

```{r}
#processing is via strptime
as.Date('19181104', format = '%Y%m%d')
```

Still, slightly different formats can make the conversion from character to dates challenging:

```{r}
as.Date(c('1918-11-04', '1918/11/04'), format = '%Y-%m-%d')
```

## Manipulating date/time with lubridate

The package `lubridate` can "guess" better than base R function dates formatting (see the book-chapter [Dates and Times](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html)).

```{r}
library(lubridate)
today()
now()
wday(now(), label = T, abbr = F)
```

Sorting the specifications for y=year, m=month, d=day, you can loosely specify a date format that is more tolerant towards little differences in the string character. Note how that makes easier to handle different formatting within the same vector (including incomplete dates):

```{r}
someDates <-  ymd(c('1918-11-04', '1918/11/04', '19181104', '191811'), truncated = 1)
dym('191811')
```

Not how class and type are the same as using `as.Date` in base R:

```{r}
class(someDates)
typeof(someDates)
```

After coercing to date, to extract single components from each date object:

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
day(ymd(myDate))
week(ymd(myDate)) 
month(ymd(myDate)) 
year(ymd(myDate)) 
```

If you need to add time to a date, sort the letters h = hours, m = minutes, s = seconds to create date-time specifications:

```{r}
datime <- ymd_hms(c('2014-01-31 23:12:31', '2014-01-31 11:12:31 pm'))
hour(datime)
minute(datime)
second(datime)
```


## Mid-term throwback exercise

#. Calculate the day of the week with the most crimes 

```{r}
load(here::here('data', 'dataset.RData'))
dt <- left_join(dt, lkt)
```

#. Use `case_when` to refactor `offensetime_discrete` using the following labels:

```{}
   - >=10.00 pm but <= 5.00 am ----> night
   - >5.00 am but <= 10.30 am ----> morning
   - >10.30 am but < 2.00 pm -----> day
   - >=2.00 am but < 5.30 pm -----> afternoon
   - anything else ---> evening
```


#. Plot the density of crimes facetting by year. Make sure each facet goes from Jan to Dec of that year only, and the x-axis shows one label for each month

```{r, error=TRUE}
#substitute ... with the appropriate code
ggplot(...) +
  geom_density(aes(x = ...)) +
  facet_wrap(~ ..., scales = ... , ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_date(name = ... , date_breaks = ..., date_labels = ...) #?strptime() for the list of specifications
```

## Exercise

Using a dataset of terrorism casualties in Europe, plot a line chart of victims by year in France and Italy. Transform years in dates so that you can format x-axis labels as two digits numbers (e.g., '80, '90) (use `date_labels).

```{r}
dt <- read_csv(file = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/terrorism/eu_terrorism_fatalities_by_country.csv')
```
