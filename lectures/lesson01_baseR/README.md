Lesson 1: Base R
================

R is an object oriented language: Everything is an object
---------------------------------------------------------

-   To create an object, assign its content to an object name using `<-` (the assignment operator)
-   Objects that allow to perform actions on other objects are called functions. They are "containers" with instructions about what to do with other objects (e.g., `mean()`, `sum()`)
-   All functions have documentation files that can be accessed using `?` (e.g., `?mean()`)
-   Every function requires a minimum set of arguments to run successfully (e.g., `mean()` requires an argument `x`)
-   Every function has constraints about the type of object to be passed (e.g., `sum()` expects a vector)

Naming rules for R objects
--------------------------

-   Names must start with a letter
-   Names can contain letters, digits, \_ and . (e.g., object, object1, object\_1, myObject, myobject, my\_object)
-   Using spaces and other symbols in objects/elements names is highly discouraged, but you can do it with `` ` `` (backtick) like in `1object` or `my object`.

Data structures
---------------

-   Vectors (e.g., `letters`) and matrices (e.g., `matrix(letters, ncol = 2)`)
-   Lists and dataframes (e.g., `iris`)
-   Tibbles (because we use the tidyverse)
-   And many others we won't look at (array, methods, etc.)

Atomic Vectors
--------------

-   A 1D collection of homogeneous elements
-   The ultimate constitutive element of any data structure
-   Vectors' types are for example: double, integer, logical, character

To create a vector use the `c()` function:

``` r
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
c(1:5)
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

Two ways to declare the type of a vector:

-   Letting R coercing to the most flexible type based on your input

``` r
typeof(c(1L, 6L, 3L))
## [1] "integer"
typeof(c("A", "character", "vector"))
## [1] "character"
typeof(c(T, TRUE, FALSE))
## [1] "logical"
```

-   Coercing using functions (`as.character()`, `as.numeric()`)

``` r
as.integer(c(1,5,7))
## [1] 1 5 7
as.integer(str(c(1L,5L,7L)))
##  int [1:3] 1 5 7
## integer(0)
as.integer(c('2','a'))
## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
## [1]  2 NA
```

What happens if you coherce to a "wrong" type? E.g.: `as.integer(c('2','a'))`

### Vector type

-   What are the types of the below vectors?
-   Is `sort()` arranging the number as you expect? Why?
-   Are all the below vectors atomic (test it using `is.atomic()`)?

``` r
sort(c("1", "2", "100", "5", "4"))
## [1] "1"   "100" "2"   "4"   "5"
sort(as.factor(c("1", "2", "100", "5", "4")))
## [1] 1   100 2   4   5  
## Levels: 1 100 2 4 5
sort(as.double(c("1", "2", "100", "5", "4")))
## [1]   1   2   4   5 100
```

### Vector indexing

You can extract elements of a vector using numeric indexing `myVector[2]` or element(s) name(s) (e.g., `myVector['name']`). Indexing starts at `[1]` (unlike other programming languages that sart at `0`).

Consider the following named vector:

``` r
menu <- c(pizza = '$8', lasagne = '$7.50', pasta = '$7')
```

To extract only the 1st and 3rd elements:

``` r
menu[c(1, 3)]
## pizza pasta 
##  "$8"  "$7"
```

You can use negative indexing to exclude elements from an object:

``` r
menu[-c(2:3)]
## pizza 
##  "$8"
```

Recursive Vectors - lists
-------------------------

-   Lists are a 1D collection of heterogeneous elements, both in terms of data structure and type:

``` r
myList <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), list(letters, c(2, 6)))
typeof(myList)
## [1] "list"
str(myList, max.level = 1)
## List of 4
##  $ : int [1:3] 1 2 3
##  $ : chr "a"
##  $ : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE
##  $ :List of 2
```

Most likely, we will never manipulate lists objects. However, many functions return lists. For example, the output of fiting a linear model `lm()` is a list:

``` r
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
str(fit, max.level = 0)
## List of 12
##  - attr(*, "class")= chr "lm"
```

Exercise
--------

Work out the exercises on a new branch of your git repo. Once you are confident that your solutions are correct, merge the branch you created to your master branch. Follow this workflow:

1.  Save and commit everything up to now
2.  Create a new branch and switch to it `$ git checkout -b solutions` (`$ git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]` to switch between branches)
3.  Go back to your master `$ git checkout master` and merge it with `solutions` using `$ git merge solutions`
4.  After you merge, commit to master and push to GitHub

Respond to the following questions and push the responses to your GitHub:

-   Create a character vector `family` with your family members' name

``` r
family <- c('Tyler','Lindsey', 'David', 'Adrienne')
```

-   Create a vector `birth` with their birth year

``` r
birth <- c(1997,1998,1954,1959)
```

-   Create another vector `age` with your family members' ages (calculated using `birth`)

``` r
age <- c(21,20,63,58)
```

-   Use `typeof()` to make sure that `family`, `birth`, and `age` are the appropriate type (character, integer/double, integer/double)

``` r
typeof(family)
## [1] "character"
typeof(birth)
## [1] "double"
typeof(age)
## [1] "double"
```

-   Use `names()` to name the elements of `age` with the family members' names from `family`

``` r
names(age) <- family
```

-   Use inline code to print your name and age (using indexing) Tyler 21

-   What happens when:
-   You extract using a positive index bigger than the vector length? When you extract using a positive index bigger than the vector length, it will not find an element and return NA.
-   You subset by a name that doesn't exist? When you subset by a name that doesn't exist, it again will not find an element and return NA.
-   You assign a number to position 20 of the age vector? When you assign a number to position 20 of the age vector, it will automatically extends the size of the vector to 20, inserts the number into position 20, and fills the remaining indexes with NA.
-   Read carefully the documentation for `is.vector()`. If `is.vector(x)` retrieves `TRUE`, does it mean that `x` is an atomic vector? For the method is.vector, a return value of TRUE does mean that it is an atomic vector and it can be optimized to find one or all of them
