`flexdashboard` is a package that leverages RMarkdown syntax for building [dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/examples.html). You can combine flexdashboard with the [shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to add interactivity to your web app, and or use CSS or JavaScript to change the page aesthetics. This makes relatively easy to deploy dashboards with little knowledge of webprogramming.

Dashboards are often used for exploratory analysis or monitoring, but they can be quite effective tools for telling _your_ data-driven story. For example, the using [story-board menus](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/jjallaire/htmlwidgets-showcase-storyboard/htmlwidgets-showcase-storyboard.html) is a very valid alternative to powerpoint presentations.


To start with `flexdashboard`, follow these [instructions](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/). To install `flexdashboard` and `shiny`

```{r}
install.packages("flexdashboard")
install.packages("shiny")
```

Our goal is to create a dashboard to analyse data about the victims of terrorism using the dataset available on the GitHub page of `fivethirtyeight`:

```{r}
dt <- read_csv(file = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/terrorism/eu_terrorism_fatalities_by_country.csv')
```


The final output is to build this [webapp](https://dario.shinyapps.io/terrorismApp_3/) to display data of terrosism casualties in Europe:

 1. Filling the dashboard tempalte with static barcharts `terrosimApp_1`
 2. Adding interactivity to the barcharts to allow selection of the state to plot `terrorismApp_2`.
 3. Adding a botton to rescale the vertical axes of the interactive charts.
